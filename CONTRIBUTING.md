### I'm having an issue:
 1. Search [issues](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Client-Storage/issues), maybe your issue is already solved
 2. Before submitting an issue make sure it's only related to `ClientStorage` package
 3. If your issue is not solved:
     - Give an expressive description of what is went wrong
     - Version of `ClientStorage` you're experiencing this issue
     - Is it NPM or Meteor (Atmosphere) package version?
     - Version of `Node.js`, `NPM` and/or `Meteor` you're experiencing this issue
     - If you're getting an error (exception), please provide full error log (output in console) as file or screenshot
